                Welcome to ...  ...is a drawing version of the classic game, Telephone. 
                The game will consist of multiple rounds that are either prompt rounds or 
                drawing rounds. In the 
                initial prompt round, players will have to come up with a prompt. Then it will be a drawing round
                Player must draw a picture that they 
                believe best represents the random prompt that they were given. Similarly,
                 the following round 
                will involve each player getting a random drawn picture they will have to 
                guess what the initial prompt was. This process repeats until all the rounds
                have concluded. Then, there will be a time at the end to collectively view the
                journey that each prompt went through
